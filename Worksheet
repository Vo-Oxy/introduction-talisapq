## Review
1. What is your favorite CS topic you've learned so far?
I have enjoyed recursion! Recursion has a set structure and gives a set outcome, which I enjoy in code. I like when code is clear and well-structured, and recursion is a perfect example of that. 

## Exploration
2. What is the most difficult CS topic you've learned so far?
This is not programming, however last semester in Comp 181 I struggled with interacton and state-machine diagrams,

## Challenge
3. What do you most look forward to learning this semester?
I look forward to learning how to maximise efficiency when attempting big projects, and understanding how to organize my code so they don't seem so daunting.
